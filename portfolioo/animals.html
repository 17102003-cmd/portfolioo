<p align="justify" style="font-size:20px">  <i>The dhole  is also called the Asiatic wild dog or Indian wild dog, is a species native to South and Southeast Asia.  The dholes are classed as endangered by the IUCN, due to ongoing habitat loss, depletion of its prey base, competition from other predators, persecution and possibly diseases from domestic and feral dogs.The dhole is a highly social animal, living in large clans which occasionally split up into small packs to hunt. It primarily preys on medium-sized deers,cattles and wild-boars, which it hunts by tiring them out in long chases, and kills by disemboweling them. Dholes let their pups eat first at a kill.Though fearful of humans, dhole packs are bold enough to attack large and dangerous animals such as wild buffalo,water buffalos, and even tigers.</i></p>
